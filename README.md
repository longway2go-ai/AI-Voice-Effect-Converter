- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit WAV output
- **Processing**: Mono and stereo input support

### Voice Volume Ranges
- **Voice Level**: 0.8 - 2.0 (recommended: 1.3)
- **Music Level**: 0.2 - 1.0 (recommended: 0.5)

### Cache Configuration
```python
TEMP_DIR = "/tmp/voice_temp"      # Temporary processing files
OUTPUT_DIR = "/tmp/voice_output"  # Final output location
CACHE_DIR = "/tmp/voice_cache"    # Download cache storage
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Voice Effect
```python
class CustomVoiceEffect(OptimizedVoiceModeler):
    @staticmethod
    def my_custom_effect(vocals, sr):
        # Custom pitch shifting
        vocals = librosa.effects.pitch_shift(vocals, sr=sr, n_steps=5)
        
        # Custom filtering
        b, a = butter(2, [1000, 3000], btype='band', fs=sr)
        vocals = filtfilt(b, a, vocals)
        
        # Custom effects
        vocals = np.tanh(vocals * 1.2) * 0.9
        
        return librosa.util.normalize(vocals) * 0.95

# Register new effect
converter.voice_modeler.custom_effect_processing = CustomVoiceEffect.my_custom_effect
converter.styles["Custom Effect"] = "custom_effect_processing"
```

### Batch Processing
```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

def batch_process_directory(input_dir, output_dir, voice_style="Animated Voice"):
    converter = OptimizedVoiceConverter()
    
    for audio_file in Path(input_dir).glob("*.wav"):
        try:
            output_path, title, time = converter.convert_voice_effect_from_file(
                str(audio_file),
                voice_style,
                vocal_vol=1.3,
                music_vol=0.5,
                progress_fn=lambda x, y: print(f"{audio_file.name}: {x:.1%}")
            )
            
            # Move to output directory
            final_path = Path(output_dir) / f"{audio_file.stem}_{voice_style}.wav"
            shutil.move(output_path, final_path)
            print(f"‚úÖ Processed: {audio_file.name} -> {final_path.name}")
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"‚ùå Failed: {audio_file.name} - {e}")

# Usage
batch_process_directory("./input_audio", "./output_audio", "Slowed + Reverb")
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Download Failures
```bash
# Update yt-dlp
pip install --upgrade yt-dlp

# Check URL validity
yt-dlp --list-formats "YOUR_YOUTUBE_URL"
```

#### Memory Issues
```python
# Reduce processing duration
converter.max_duration = 60  # seconds

# Force garbage collection
import gc
gc.collect()
```

#### Audio Quality Issues
```python
# Increase sample rate (requires more memory)
y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path, sr=44100)

# Adjust processing parameters
vocal_vol = 1.1  # Lower for cleaner sound
music_vol = 0.7  # Higher for better balance
```

#### FFmpeg Not Found
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Add to PATH (Windows)
# Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
# Add bin folder to system PATH
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Low-Memory Systems
```python
# Reduce STFT parameters
S = librosa.stft(y, n_fft=1024, hop_length=256)  # Instead of 2048/512

# Process in chunks
chunk_size = sr * 30  # 30 seconds
for i in range(0, len(audio), chunk_size):
    chunk = audio[i:i+chunk_size]
    # Process chunk
```

#### For Faster Processing
```python
# Use lower quality for testing
ydl_opts['format'] = 'worstaudio[abr<64]'

# Skip effects for testing
def test_processing(vocals, sr):
    return vocals  # No processing

converter.styles["Test"] = "test_processing"
```
